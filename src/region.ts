 * being a legal cut (a tool-pairing question, decided by the host helpers)
 * with carrying a bare-seq id (an id-dialect detail), and it permanently

 *   Such a node can never be a legal END edge anyway (its open calls make
 *   every cut after it unbalanced), so only the start side matters. The ref
 *   layer maps the edge onto the node's sub-ids (edgeRefForSeq in tools.ts).
 * - An EMPTY tool result projects to NO message at all. It carries no
 *   characters, so anchoring a cut on it loses nothing; the host's pairing
 *   balance counts it like any other result (-1), so balance at its cuts is
 *   well-defined. The ref layer falls back to the nearest message-bearing
 *   node inside the span.
 *
 * Everything else keeps the old rule: a user turn anchors only with non-empty

/**
 * Compressible spans in the DSH seq dialect, for the nudge range table.
 *
 * The GEOMETRY — which messages group into one compressible span — comes from
 * the kernel's own ranges (design decision 7: the kernel owns the algorithm).
 * The kernel splits a group when the next message is a user turn and the group
 * already holds 3+ messages, and after any protected or already-compressed
 * message, so a row reads as "roughly one stretch of work" rather than an
 * arbitrary slice. This function only does the two jobs the kernel cannot:
 *
 * 1. Translate refs into surface seqs — DSH has no `<acp>` ref tags; seq is our
 *    ref (design decision 2).
 * 2. Apply the host guards on top of the kernel's grouping: injected
 *    instruction rows split a span and the newest copy of every scope is never
 *    offered, checkpoints and the surface's system node are not compressible,
 *    and the recent tail plus the last REAL user turn stay protected (rule 16).
 *
 * History — why this used to compute the spans itself. A kernel range's edges
 * were derived by counting refs, and a surface replacement breaks that
 * arithmetic: the checkpoint node of a replace lands mid-array carrying a much
 * higher ref, so ref order and array order diverge and the spans came back
 * reversed (`end < start`) or lost large tool results entirely. The table was
 * therefore self-computed from the surface, labeled `UPSTREAM:` and tracked as
 * issue #38 (rule 11). The pinned kernel segments by ARRAY adjacency instead
 * (upstream #207) and the drift is gone — measured on a session whose
 * compressed span sits in the MIDDLE of the surface: every ref resolves to the
 * right seq, no span crosses the shadowed hole, and the compressed span is
 * excluded. Rules 3 and 11 are updated with it.
