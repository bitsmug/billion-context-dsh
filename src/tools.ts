/**
 * Pure gate helpers for the compress tool's CURRENT-instruction-row rejection.

 * compression is safe and self-healing. The owner reversed that during PR1
 * review: compressing a CURRENT row has NO legitimate outcome — the host
 * re-injects the newest AGENTS.md copy unconditionally the moment it leaves
 * the surface (presence gate, deepseek-harness
 * packages/context/agent-instructions/src/index.ts:137/:163), so the tokens
 * come straight back and the call is pure waste — and a hard reject keeps the
 * manual path consistent with the system-side GC's iron rule (PR2: never
 * clear a group's newest row). STALE copies stay compressible: removing them
 * while the newest stays visible is the actual cleanup and triggers no
 * re-injection. The range table (buildCompressibleSeqRanges) never offers
 * these rows, so the gate only fires on hand-built ranges.
 *
 * `guardedRowsInSpan` is the overlap probe. It takes the POSITIONAL span the
 * transaction will actually shadow (`shadowedSeqsOf`), never a numeric
 * `start <= seq <= end` interval: the surface is locally non-monotonic after
 * earlier replacements (a checkpoint seq spliced ahead of older residual
 * nodes), so a tier-2 distill of two checkpoints can carry a CURRENT
 * instruction row numerically inside its edges while the sliced span excludes
 * it — the interval probe rejected exactly the call the nudge hands the model
 * (issue #71 review B1). Probing the slice also keeps guard and effect in
 * agreement: `shadowedSeqsOf` is what the transaction prices and
 * `assertProvenance` verifies.
 * `protectedRowRejectionNote` renders the rejection the model sees: it names
 * the offending seqs AND the compressible slices left in the span, so the model
 * can re-cut (or split into two calls) instead of retrying the same call.
 * `guardedSurfaceSeqsOf` supplies the protected set.
